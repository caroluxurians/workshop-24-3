## How to contribute to this workshop demo

#### **Did you find a bug?**

-   Fill in new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/oss-institute/workshop-template/issues).

-   **Ensure the bug was not already reported**.

-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/oss-institute/workshop-template/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch for existing bug or issue?**

-   Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

-   Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number.

-   Before submitting, make sure both `lint` and `tests` are passing.

-   In case you added a new functionality, always add a new test. This does not apply for visual changes (cosmetic changes, typos, updates in styles).
